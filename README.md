# Hive Helsinki: Lem_in
C — Getting deeper into algorithms.

## Challenge
Lem_in is essentially a graph and flow problem. Move x amount of "ants" Through a graph consisting of connected nodes. 

## Solution
We implemented the Edmonds-Karp algorithm, in which we find the shortest paths using breadth-first search while also allowing negative flow to get the optimal paths.
